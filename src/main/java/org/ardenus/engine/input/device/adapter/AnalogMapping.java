/**
 * A {@link DeviceAnalog} mapping for use with a {@link DeviceAdapter}.
 * <p>
 * On their own, an analog mapping cannot provide a meaningful mapping for an
 * analog feature. It must be extended by a class which provides information
 * meaningful to the context of a relevant device adapter. This can be as simple
 * as providing an extra field for an analog ID. An example of this would be:
 * 
 * <pre>
 * public class GlfwAnalogMapping extends AnalogMapping {
 * 
 * 	public final int glfwAxis;
 * 
 * 	public GlfwAnalogMapping(DeviceAnalog analog, int glfwAxis) {
 * 		super(analog);
 * 		this.glfwAxis = glfwAxis;
 * 	}
 * 
 * }
 * </pre>
 * 
 * @param <A>
 *            the device analog type.
 * @see ButtonMapping
 * @see RumbleMapping

	 * @param analog
	 *            the analog being mapped to.
	 * @throws NullPointerException
	 *             if {@code analog} is {@code null}.
